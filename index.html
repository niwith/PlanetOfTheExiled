<p>Planet of The Exiled is an RTS like game with a twist. Rather than playing individual missions the entire game occurs on one map. The idea of the game as it stands at this time is you will control a small community of people living on a planet that has drifted away from its star. This group of people live around one of the few locations of heat activity on the surface of the planet, however when it runs out of energy and begins to cool the people must journey to another location where they can settle. Your goal is to keep them alive in the harsh wasteland and lead them to their new home. You will have to manage their food, defenses, fuel, heat and building components (subject to change). You will encounter many obstacles to overcome such as wasteland bandits, animals, lack of food, cold etc. </p>

<p>For anyone who has stumbled across this page and does not know the dev team, we a group of very amature programmers so dont get your hopes up about this game being any good, its more of a learning experience for us. Though if you want to show your support or make suggestions it would mean alot to us.</p>
